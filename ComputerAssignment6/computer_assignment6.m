% Initial positions y(0) and velocities v(0):

v0 = [500; 500; 500; 500; 500];  % Column Vector; all 500 initially

% Control gains and desired spacing:
alpha = 1;  % Stiffness coefficient
beta = 2;  % Damping coefficient
d = 10;  % Desired neighbor spacing

% Adjacency Matrix (A) -- "Who talks to whom"
% Jet 1 --> connected to Jet 2
% Jet 2 --> connected to Jets 1 and 3
% Jet 3 --> connected to Jets 2 and 4
% Jet 4 --> connected to jets 3 and 5
% Jet 5 --> connected to Jet 4
A = [ 0, 1, 0, 0, 0;
      1, 0, 1, 0, 0;
      0, 1, 0, 1, 0;

% Each row represents one jet
% Each column shows which other jets it can sense/communicate with
% A '1' in row i, column j means that jet i and jet j can communicate
% A '0' means no direct communication
% The matrix is symmetric since communication is bidirectional

% y2 - y1 --> d
% y3 - y2 --> d
% y3 - y4 --> d
% y4 - y5 --> d
% That implies (by definition Deltaij = lim t->inf (yi - yj)
% Delta12 means the position of jet 1 minus the position of jet 2
% Delta21 means the position of jet 2 minus the position of jet 1
% Edge (1,2): delta21 = d :: delta12 = -d
% Edge (2,3): delta32 = d :: delta23 = -d
% Edge (3,4): delta34 = d :: delta43 = -d
% Edge (4,5): delta45 = d :: delta54 = -d

% Degree Matrix (D) -- "How many neighbors each jet has"
% Jet 1 --> 1 neighbor
% Jet 2 --> 2 neighbors
% Jet 3 --> 2 neighbors
% Jet 4 --> 2 neighbors
% Jet 5 --> 1 neighbor
% Degree matrix D (|Ni| on the diagonal): ends have 1 neighbor, middle
% have 2
D = [ 1, 0, 0, 0, 0;
      0, 2, 0, 0, 0;
      0, 0, 2, 0, 0;
      0, 0, 0, 2, 0;
      0, 0, 0, 0, 1 ];
% Dii = number of neighbors (the 'degree' of node i)
% Off-diagonal entries are zero since no jet's degree depends on others
% Multiplying by this matrix makes it so jets that have two neighbors (like
% 2, 3, 4) do not end up reacting with twice the corrective force of jets
% that have only one neighbor (like 1 and 5)

% Laplacian Matrix (L = D - A) -- "Relative difference operator"
L = D - A;
% Computing this gives:
% L =
%      1    -1     0     0     0
%     -1     2    -1     0     0
%      0    -1     2    -1     0
%      0     0    -1     2    -1
%      0     0     0    -1     1
% The diagonal element Lii = number of neighbors (from D)
% The off-diagonal element Lij = - 1 if jet i and jet j are connected
% Why this matters: When you multiply L by a position vector y, this
% produces the sum of all relative position errors for each jet with its
% neighbors
% It measures how far each jet is from being aligned with its neighbors

% Inside the differential equation for a single jet i, it tells us:
% Each jet looks at its position and velocity relative to its neighbors
% Deltaij is the desired spacing between jets i and j
% Alpha and Beta control how strongly the jets react to position or
% velocity errors

% Inside the sum, we have (yi - yj - deltaij)
% That term measures how far jet i is from where it should be relative to
% jet j
% If yi - yj > deltaij : jet i is too far -> it slows down
% If yi - yj < deltaij : j i is too close -> it speeds up

% We can use this to simplify the given differential equation
% Create column vectors y(t) and v(t) to collect all positions and
% velocities
% Using the Laplacian L = D - A matrix, it encodes all relative
% differences
% Then the sum of differences over all neighbors can be compactly written
% as Ly and Lv

% This condenses the differential equation into
%  dvi(t)     -1
%  -----  = -D  [ alpha * (Ly(t) - b) + beta*Lv(t) ]
%    dtpwd
% Where b is the collection of the delta terms

% Compute bi = Sigma   Deltaij
%               j element of Ni

%    Jet    Neighbors    bi                                result
%     1        {2}       delta12 = -d                        -d
%     2        {1,3}     delta21 + delta23 = d - d            0
%     3        {2,4}     delta32 + delta34 = d + d           2d
%     4        {3,5}     delta43 + delta45 = -d + d           0
%     5        {4}       delta 54 = -d                       -d
b = [-d; 0; 2*d; 0; -d];
% Therefore, b acts like a bias correction vector that tells the controller
% what steady-state geometry formation shape we want

%% --- Part 1:    lim   v_i(t)    ---
%               t -> inf
% With relative-only coupling, the average velocity is invariant, and the
% damping term beta*L drives velocity difference to zero. Therefore, all
% velocities converge to the common value equal to the initial average.
v_0 = 500;              % Initial average velocity
v_inf = v_0*ones(5,1);  

disp('Part 1: Steady-state velocities:');
disp('lim_{t->inf} v_i(t) = ');
disp(v_inf);  % Expect all 500

% The formation reaches the right shape (relative distance) and then moves
% together with a common constant velocity c. In this case, c = 500, but c
% is not arbitrary; instead, it is based on the initial given velocities
